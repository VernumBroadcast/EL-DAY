## 📁 What's What?

### Files You Should Look At:
- **index.html** - The main page (you probably don't need to edit this)

### Helpful Guides:
- **START_HERE.md** - This file!

## 💕 Making It Personal (The Important Part!)

The app works great as-is, but **the magic happens when you personalize it**!

### 5-Minute Version (Minimal Personalization):
1. Open `script.js`
2. Search for "Good morning, Angel!" (first description)
3. Change descriptions to reference things you actually do
4. Update at least a few choice options to be specific places
5. Save!

### 30-Minute Version (Highly Recommended!):
1. Fill out **QUOTES_TEMPLATE.md** with your ideas
2. Open `script.js`
3. Update all the `loveQuotes` array with personal messages
4. Update all the descriptions with inside jokes and references
5. Make every choice option specific (real restaurants, real activities)
6. Write captions that reference actual memories
7. Test it!

### 1-Hour Version (Perfect!):
- Do everything in the 30-minute version
- Add MORE quotes (the more the better!)
- Reference specific dates and memories
- Include inside jokes throughout
- Change the end screen message to something super personal
- Maybe even adjust the times to match your actual plan for the day!

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I need to add real pictures?**
A: No! It currently generates random beautiful pictures. But you CAN add your own photos to the `images` folder if you want.

**Q: What if I want to test it but it's not the right time?**
A: Temporarily change all `timeStart` values to `0` in script.js, then change them back.

**Q: Can I change the times?**
A: Yes! Edit both the `time` (display text) and `timeStart` (unlock time) in script.js.

**Q: Can I add more time slots?**
A: Yes! See CUSTOMIZATION_GUIDE.md for instructions.

**Q: Do I need internet?**
A: Only for the random pictures. Everything else works offline.

**Q: Can Ellie access this on her phone?**
A: Yes! Either send her the files, or host it online (see README.md for hosting options).

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Problem: Time slots won't unlock**
- Check your computer's clock is set correctly
- Remember: 10 AM = `timeStart: 10`, 2 PM = `timeStart: 14`, 8 PM = `timeStart: 20`

**Problem: Quotes aren't changing**
- Wait 10 seconds - they rotate automatically
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

**Problem: Pictures not loading**
- Make sure you have internet connection (for random pictures)
- Or add your own pictures to the images folder

**Problem: Page looks broken**
- Make sure all three files are in the same folder: index.html, styles.css, script.js
- Try a different browser
