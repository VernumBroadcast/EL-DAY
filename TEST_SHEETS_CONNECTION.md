**Public JSON endpoint:**
```

## Still Not Working?

### Check These:
1. ‚úÖ Sheet published to web?
2. ‚úÖ Sheet shared publicly (anyone with link can view)?
3. ‚úÖ Tab name is "ELDAY"?
4. ‚úÖ Sheet ID in script.js matches your sheet?
5. ‚úÖ Clicked refresh button on website?
6. ‚úÖ Checked browser console for errors?

### Last Resort:
1. Try opening the sheet in an incognito window
2. If you can't access it = not public
3. Make it public and try again!
