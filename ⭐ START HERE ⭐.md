## 🎯 Google Sheets = GAME CHANGER

**Why you NEED this:**

Imagine: It's 11 AM. Ellie is about to choose a lunch spot. You notice:
- It's raining (scratch the outdoor option)
- She mentioned wanting sushi this morning
- That new place just opened

**Without Google Sheets:** She's stuck with the original options.

**With Google Sheets:** 
1. You pull up the sheet on your phone
2. Change "Outdoor picnic" to "That new sushi place"
3. Text her: "Refresh the page, Angel 😏"
4. She clicks ↻ Refresh Choices
5. Sees the new option
6. Picks it
7. You're boyfriend of the year

**Setup time:** 5 minutes  
**Coolness factor:** INFINITE

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Test It First
Open `index.html` on YOUR phone before giving it to Ellie. Make sure:
- Buttons work
- Photos load
- Text is readable
- Everything looks good

### 2. Set Up Google Sheets
**Seriously, do this.** The ability to update choices mid-day is GAME CHANGING.

**Real scenario:**
- Original choice: "Movie at 2 PM"
- Reality: Movie is sold out
- Solution: Update sheet to "Netflix at home" or "Different movie at 4"
- Crisis averted

### 3. Customize the Text
The fallback choices are funny, but YOUR inside jokes are better:
- Edit the `fallbackData` in script.js
- Or update your Google Sheet
- Make every choice reference something personal

### 4. Plan Ahead
Have actual activities ready:
- Restaurant reservations
- Backup plans for weather
- Surprises for each time slot
- Turn the adventure into reality!

### 5. Document Everything
- Take photos at each activity
- Add them to the memories folder later
- Make it a tradition!

## 🐛 Quick Troubleshooting

**Q: It's before 10 AM and everything is locked**  
A: That's correct! Wait until 10 AM, or temporarily change `timeStart` values in script.js to `0` for testing.

**Q: Google Sheets data not loading**  
A: Check:
- Sheet is "published to web"
- Sheet is shared publicly
- Sheet ID is correct in script.js (line 3)
- Sheet tab name is "Adventures" or matches line 4

**Q: Photos not showing**  
A: Make sure you're opening index.html from the "EL DAY" folder, not from somewhere else.

**Q: Text is too small on phone**  
A: Really? It should be big! Try a different browser or check if you zoomed out.

**Q: Refresh button doesn't work**  
A: If Google Sheets isn't set up, it won't do anything (that's okay!). It only works with Google Sheets integration.

## 🎁 How to Present It

### The Mysterious Approach:
```
Text at 9:50 AM:
"Hello You, I made something for you.
It's slightly unhinged.
You'll either love it or question my sanity.
Open this link at 10 AM: [link]
Trust me. 💅"
```

### The Direct Approach:
```
"Angel, I created a whole choose-your-own-adventure
day for us. It's on your phone. 
Check it out at 10 AM.
Also, it updates throughout the day.
Also, I may be slightly obsessed with you.
Also, you're welcome. 💕"
```

### The Casual Approach:
```
"Hey, click this thing I made.
No, I won't explain.
Just click it.
At 10 AM.
You're going to love it.
Or think I'm insane.
Win-win."
```
