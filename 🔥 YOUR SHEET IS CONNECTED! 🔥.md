## 🔥 Now You Can Do This:

### Live Update Magic ✨

**Scenario 1: Weather Changes**
```
Original: 🌳 Touch grass (main character walk in nature)
*It starts raining*
Update in sheet: 🌂 Rainy day museum visit instead
Ellie clicks refresh → sees new option!
```

**Scenario 2: Spontaneous Idea**
```
*10:30 AM - You think of something better*
Update the lunch options in the sheet
Text her: "Hey Angel, refresh the page 😏"
She sees your new choice appear
BOYFRIEND POINTS: 1000
```

**Scenario 3: Real-Time Adaptation**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Refresh button does nothing"
→ Check that you published the sheet to web AND set sharing to public

### "Console shows error loading sheets"
→ Sheet might not be public. Go to Share → Change to "Anyone with link"

### "Data looks wrong"
→ Make sure tab name is "ELDAY" (not "Sheet1" or something else)

### "Some choices missing"
→ Check that you have Choice1, Caption1, Choice2, Caption2 filled in (Choice3 is optional)
