# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## Step 1: Add Your Photos
Put 18 photos in the `images` folder. See `images/README.txt` for the exact filenames needed.

## Step 2: Customize the Choices (Optional but Recommended!)
Open `script.js` and edit the `adventureData` object:

**Example - Change a choice:**
```javascript
{
    text: "🎨 Visit an art gallery or museum together",  // ← Change this
    picture: "images/morning1.jpg",
    caption: "Remember when we got lost in the world of art together?"  // ← And this
}
```

**Make it personal!** Add:
- Inside jokes
- References to real dates you've had
- Specific restaurants or places you love
- Sweet messages just for Ellie

## Step 3: Test It!
1. Double-click `index.html` to open in your browser
2. Click through each choice to make sure it works
3. Check that pictures are loading correctly

## Step 4: Present It to Ellie! 🎁
- Open it on your computer/tablet for her
- Or send her the files to open on her device
- Or host it online (see below)

## 🌐 Optional: Put It Online

3. Upload all the files
4. Enable GitHub Pages in settings
5. Share the link!
