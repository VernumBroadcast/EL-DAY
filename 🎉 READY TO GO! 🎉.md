# 🎉 YOUR ADVENTURE IS READY! 🎉

## ✅ Everything is Set Up!

Great news! I noticed you already have **29 photos of you and Ellie** in the images folder!

The adventure is now configured to:
✨ Use YOUR actual photos (not random placeholders!)
🔀 Randomly shuffle them each time the page loads
📸 Show a different photo with each choice
💕 Never repeat photos until all have been shown
🎨 Beautiful pink UI throughout
⏰ Time-based unlocking throughout the day
💬 Personal nicknames (Angel, Darling, Hello You, Trouble, El)
🌟 Rotating love quotes every 10 seconds

---

## 🚀 TO START: Just double-click `index.html`!

**That's it!** The adventure works right now with:
- Your 29 photos automatically loaded
- Pink romantic theme
- Time-based unlocking
- All 6 time slots ready to go

---

## 💕 The One Thing Left: Personalize the Text!

The app is **fully functional** right now, but to make it truly special for Ellie, you should customize the text. This is the most important part!

### Quick 10-Minute Personalization:
1. Open `script.js`
2. Search for each time slot (lateMorning, lunch, etc.)
3. Update the `description` fields with inside jokes
4. Change a few choice options to be specific places
5. Done!

### Full Personalization (Recommended!):
Use **QUOTES_TEMPLATE.md** - it's a fill-in-the-blank template that makes it super easy!

## 📸 Your Photos

Your 29 photos will be randomly shuffled each time Ellie (or you) opens the page, so:
- Each visit shows photos in a different order
- No two playthroughs will be exactly the same
- If she plays again, she'll see different photos with different choices
- All photos will be used before any repeat

**You have more than enough photos!** (6 choices = 6 photos per playthrough, and you have 29)

## ❓ Quick Troubleshooting

**Q: Can I test it right now?**
A: Yes! Double-click `index.html`. If it's before 10 AM, you'll see the locked message. Use one of the testing methods above to unlock everything.

**Q: The photos show but they're not the right ones**
A: Make sure you're opening `index.html` from the "EL DAY" folder, not from somewhere else.

**Q: I want to add/remove/change photos**
A: Just add/remove files in the `images/` folder. The script automatically uses all .jpeg files it finds there.

**Q: Can I change the color scheme?**
A: Yes! Edit `styles.css` and search for `#ff6b9d` (pink) and `#c44569` (darker pink) and replace with your colors.

**Q: I want different time slots**
A: Edit the `timeStart` values in `script.js` for each time slot.
